# HOME CREDIT DEFAULT RISK
# Most features are created by applying min, max, mean, sum and var functions to grouped tables.
# Little feature selection is done and overfitting might be a problem since many features are related.
# The following key ideas were used:
# - Divide or subtract important features to get rates (like annuity and income)
# - In Bureau Data: create specific features for Active credits and Closed credits
# - In Previous Applications: create specific features for Approved and Refused applications
# - Modularity: one function for each table (except bureau_balance and application_test)
# - One-hot encoding for categorical features
# All tables are joined with the application DF using the SK_ID_CURR key (except bureau_balance).
# You can use LightGBM with KFold or Stratified KFold.
